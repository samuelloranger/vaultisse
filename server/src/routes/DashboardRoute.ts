/**
 * GET /dashboard
 * ---------------
 * Returns all the counters/series the dashboard needs in one round trip,

 * whole shared library, not the caller's own contributions - the dashboard
 * describes the household's collection.
 *
 * Auth: required.

 * Example response (200):
 *  {

 *                     "isbn": "9780261102217", "pages": 310, "date_created": "2026-08-01T..." }],
 *    "totalBooks": 42,
 *    "totalThisMonth": 3,
 *    "totalLastMonth": 5,
 *    "totalCategories": 6,
 *    "totalCustomers": 10,
 *    "booksInTime": [{ "month": "2026-08-01T00:00:00.000Z", "total_books": 3 }],
 *    "stockStatus": [{ "status": 0, "count": 20 }, { "status": 2, "count": 5 }],
 *    "totalBookedBooks": 5,
 *    "totalLocations": 2,
 *    "totalAuthors": 15,
 *    "categoryShelves": [{ "id": 3, "name": "Fantasy", "count": 10,
 *                          "books": [{ "id": 12, "name": "The Hobbit", "image_url": "..." }] }],

 *                          "customerId": 4, "customerName": "Maria Puig" }]
 *  }
 *
 * Note: Postgres `COUNT(*)` yields a `bigint`, which node-postgres
 * serializes as a string to avoid precision loss - every count below is
 * cast back to a `number` before being sent, since a user's library is
 * nowhere near `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` and the client types (and Vuetify
 * prop checks) expect actual numbers.
