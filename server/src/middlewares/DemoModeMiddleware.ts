/**
 * When DEMO_MODE=true, rejects every state-changing request so a public
 * demo deployment can't be used to modify or pollute the shared data.
 * GET/HEAD/OPTIONS always pass through; the login flow is explicitly
 * allowlisted since visitors still need to sign in as the demo user.
 * `/register` is deliberately NOT allowlisted - the demo ships with a
 * fixed account instead of letting visitors create their own.
 *
 * Mounted globally in AppService, ahead of the route registry, so it
 * covers both AuthRoute (mounted at "/") and every "/api/rest/*" router.
