/**
 * Express middleware that gates every authenticated route.
 *
 * Flow: read the `token` httpOnly cookie -> verify its JWT signature/claims
 * -> look up the user and compare `token_version` (a DB counter bumped on
 * password change, so old tokens can be revoked even though JWTs are
 * otherwise stateless) -> look up the specific `user_sessions` row the
 * token's `sid` claim identifies and reject if it's been individually
 * revoked (see "Log out this device" in Settings) -> if valid and about to
 * expire, silently reissue a fresh cookie -> call `next()`.
 *
 * In development (`ALLOW_DEV_AUTH=true`), it skips real auth entirely and
 * fakes a session for user id 1 - never enable this in production. The fake
 * token's `sid` is a sentinel that never matches a real `user_sessions` row
 * (there was never a real login to create one), so the per-session check
 * below is skipped for it too.
 *
 * Two variants share this same resolution logic (see `resolveSession`),
 * differing only in how they fail:
 *  - `requireAuth` - for `/api/rest/*` JSON endpoints. Usage:
 *    `router.get('/foo', requireAuth, handler)`. Failure responses: 401
 *    `{message: "Unauthorized", sessionExpired: true}` (missing/invalid/
 *    expired/revoked token) - `sessionExpired` is what the client's axios
 *    interceptor (axiosInstance.ts) keys off of to redirect to `/login`,
 *    as opposed to a 401 from actual in-page logic (a wrong current
 *    password, say) that has no reason to force a redirect.
 *  - `requireAuthPage` - for the server-rendered `/app` and `/app/*` HTML
 *    routes (AuthRoute.ts). Failure: redirects to `/login` either way,
 *    since there's no SPA yet on screen to show a JSON error in.
