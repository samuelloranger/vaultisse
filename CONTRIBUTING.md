# Contributing to Vaultisse

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document explains how to set up the
project locally, the conventions we follow, and how to get a change merged.

By participating in this project you agree to abide by our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs or unexpected behavior
- Suggest or design new features
- Improve documentation (this file included!)
- Fix bugs or implement features from open issues
- Add or improve translations
- Improve test coverage

If you're not sure whether a change is wanted, open an issue first to discuss it
before investing time in a pull request.

## Project setup

See the [README](README.md#getting-started) for full setup instructions (database,
environment variables, running the client and server). In short:

```bash
# server
cd server
bun install
bun run dev

# client (in another terminal)
cd client-react
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Repository layout

This is a workspace-free monorepo with two independent Bun projects:

- `client-react/` — React 19 SPA (TanStack Router + Query, Tamagui, Vite, TypeScript)
- `server/` — Express REST API (TypeScript, PostgreSQL), run directly by Bun

Both are on Bun 1.4 and TypeScript 7, and each has its own `bun.lock`. Linting and
formatting are [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) on both sides, with two configs: the root
`biome.json` covers `server/`, and `client-react/biome.json` covers the client.
`client-react/README.md` documents the client's layout rules; read it before adding a
screen.

See the [Architecture section of the README](README.md#architecture) for how the
code is organized inside each and how they communicate.

## Coding conventions

- **TypeScript everywhere.** Avoid `any` where a real type is easy to express;
  existing `//@ts-ignore` usages in older code are not a license to add new ones.
- **Follow existing patterns.** New backend resources should get their own route
  file under `server/src/routes/` and be registered in `Routes.ts`, mirroring the
  existing resources (books, authors, categories, ...). New frontend features
  should follow the `api/ → queries/ → routes/ + features/` split every screen
  already uses — the nine numbered rules in
  [`client-react/README.md`](client-react/README.md) are the short version, and
  [docs/CLIENT-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/CLIENT-ARCHITECTURE.md) explains why each exists.
- **Keep the client thin.** Business logic and data access belong in the server;
  the client should call the REST API rather than talking to the database or
  external APIs (Google Books/Open Library) directly.
- **Security-sensitive code** (auth, password handling, session/cookie logic,
  anything touching `AuthMiddleware.ts` or `AuthRoute.ts`) should be changed
  carefully and called out explicitly in your PR description.
- **Lint and types:** Biome is the linter and formatter on both sides —
  `bun run lint` at the repo root for `server/`, `bun run lint` in `client-react/`
  for the client. `tsc --noEmit` (`bun run type-check` in `client-react/`) should
  pass with no new type errors.
- **Tests:** `bun test` in `server/` for the API suite, `bunx vitest run` in
  `client-react/` for the client's. See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).
- Don't commit `.env` files, real credentials, or personal data/book covers used
  only for local testing.

## Commit messages

Write short, imperative commit messages describing *what* changed (e.g.
`Add ISBN lookup fallback to Open Library`, `Fix stock status not updating on
return`). Group unrelated changes into separate commits/PRs where practical.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`:
   `git checkout -b my-feature`
2. Make your change, following the conventions above.
3. Run the relevant checks:
   ```bash
   bun run lint                              # server (from the repo root)
   cd server && bun test
   cd client-react && bun run lint && bun run type-check && bunx vitest run
   ```
4. Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`. Describe:
   - What the change does and why
   - How you tested it (steps, screenshots for UI changes)
   - Any schema changes (see below) or breaking changes
5. Be responsive to review feedback. Small, focused PRs are easier to review and
   merge quickly than large ones.

### Database schema changes

If your change requires a schema change, add it to **both**:

- `assets/db/databaseSchema.sql` — always current, the only thing a fresh install runs.
- `assets/db/upgrade/X.Y.Z.sql` (or `X.Y.Z/N.sql` if that version needs more than
  one file) — upgrade file for existing installs, named after the version it
  ships in. See [`assets/db/upgrade/README.md`](assets/db/upgrade/README.md)
  for the full convention.

Treat a file under `assets/db/upgrade/` as append-only once it's part of a
release — mention the new/updated file in your PR description.

## Reporting bugs

Open a [GitHub issue](../../issues) with:

- A clear description of the problem and the expected behavior
- Steps to reproduce (and, if relevant, sample data/ISBN)
- Environment details (OS, Bun/PostgreSQL versions, browser)
- Relevant logs or console/network errors, with any secrets redacted

For security vulnerabilities, do **not** open a public issue — see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

## Suggesting features

Open an issue describing the problem you're trying to solve (not just the
solution) so it can be discussed before implementation starts. This helps avoid
wasted effort on features that don't fit the project's direction.

Check [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) first — it lists feature ideas that are already
wanted but don't have anyone working on them yet.

## Adding a new language

UI labels live in the `app_languages` / `app_labels` tables (see
`assets/db/databaseSchema.sql`) and reach the client in `GET /app/policy`'s `labels`
map (`server/src/routes/AppRoute.ts`). To add a language:

1. Insert a row into `app_languages` for the new language code.
2. Add the corresponding `app_labels` rows for every existing `code`, translated.
3. Add it to `UI_LANGUAGES` in
   `client-react/src/features/settings/ProfileCard.tsx` — the list the Settings
   language selector offers, deliberately separate from the policy's `languages`
   (which is the *book* language reference list).

Note that the React client does not render those labels yet: it fetches them with the
policy but its own strings are still hardcoded English. Adding a language to the
database is useful groundwork, but it won't change what's on screen until the
label lookup the rewrite design calls for lands.
